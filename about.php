               <h3>Review of Project Phase 2 by Christopher Ermel(200250446):</h3>
               <p>Throughout the development of this site I had encountered little challenges. I had some issues with html and the interaction with concatenation as while as some variables(minor issues). The biggest issue I had when developing this site was adding the profile picture submission. The validation for png, jpg, etc files was difficult at first, but I found an easy way to include this validation after some attempts. The other issue I had was with the login portal and hashing the passwords. At first I was using an older method of hashing and have since updated the code to the correct and safer methods. I do believe I could have made the forums better looking if I had more time and knowledge. Over all I feel I have gained a great amount of knowledge in HTML, CSS and PHP throughout the completion of this project. I look forward to continuing the development of this site.</p>
               <h4>My next steps are as follows:</h4>
               <p>-Fix issue with character countdown limit on form</p>
               <p>-Style the form data in a better looking way</p>
               <p>-Develop a better login portal with more options</p>
               <p>-Develop a better form for displaying all user records on the site</p>
